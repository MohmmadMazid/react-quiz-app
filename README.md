## 🧠 How the Quiz Works

1. The app fetches quiz questions from a **local JSON API**.
2. The user starts the quiz from the **Start Screen**.
3. Each correct answer adds points to the score.
4. A timer counts down during the quiz.
5. The quiz finishes when:

   * All questions are answered, or
   * Time runs out.
6. The final score and **high score** are displayed.

---

## ⏱ Timer Logic

Quiz time is calculated using:

```
Total Time = Number of Questions × Time per Question
```

Example:

```
10 Questions × 30 seconds = 300 seconds
```

---

## 🔄 State Management

The app uses **React `useReducer`** to manage complex state including:

* quiz status (`loading`, `ready`, `active`, `finish`)
* current question index
* selected answer
* score and high score
* remaining time

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Save high score in **localStorage**
* Add quiz categories
* Add difficulty levels
* Improve UI animations
* Deploy the application online
